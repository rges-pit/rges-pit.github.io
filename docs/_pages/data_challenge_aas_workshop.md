>  |  January 3rd or 4th, 2026  |  9am - 5pm  |  AAS 247  |  *room currently unknown*

## Requirements

* A laptop with a functioning web browser (optionally, VSCode and Slack installed).
* Idealy, some Python experience.
* An intention to participate in the [Roman Microlensing Data Challenge 2025]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge), or be on an already signed up team. You can sign up [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/sign-up).
* Microlensing-specific knowledge or experience is **not** necessary.

## How to Sign Up to the Workshop

## Session Outlines

### [1. Introduction to the Nexus]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/1-nexus/)

For discussion, information, troubleshooting, and updates about the Nexus, see the `#nexus` channel and the channel canvas. 
In this session we will be covering:

* Creating Nexus accounts
* How to access the Nexus
* Nexus notebook content:
    * Creating Teams
    * Microlensing open source software
    * Accessing data and creating data challenge submissions
* Installing packages and other technical help
* Using the Nexus with VSCode or Colab

### [2. Single Lenses and Pipelines]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/2-single-lenses/)

In this session we will learn about basic microlensing parameterization and terminology and test that knowledge out on a mini modeling data challenge.
Topic covered:

* An introduction to microlensing
* Helpful microlensing resources
* Alternate data access, for those not using the Nexus
* Hack-session where we will learn about:
    * Single lens fitting
    * Priors
    * Parallelization
    * L2 observer
    * Anomaly finding

### [3. Binary Lenses]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/3-binary-lenses/)

We will begin this sessions with a more complicated, binary-lens model, and exercises to demonstrate the challenges of binary lens fitting and common approaches to dealing with these challenges. We will fit that same event using three different methods

1. Start a fit from an uninformed guess
2. Start with a grid search 
3. Start from an informed guess

Some of these methods are computationally expensive, so we will parallelize our efforts by learning about challenges with microlensing binary-lens modellng. E.g.: 

* degeneracies, 
* stochastic likelihood space, 
* higher-order effects

### [4. Information Session and Q&A]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/4-info/)

Ask the demonstrators anything you would like to know about microlensing and/or the data challenge. 
They will also be providing details on:

* The RGES-PIT website
    * Resources and links
* The Slack channel
    * Resources and links
    * Nancy
    * General assistance
    * Private team channels
    * Workshop content
* Signup
* Tiers
* Data insights
* Submissions rules/guidelines
* Evaluation process and rubric
* Publication plans
* Important dates
* Contact
