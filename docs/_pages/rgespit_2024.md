The second annual RGES PIT face-to-face meeting took place in October 2024 at NASA’s Goddard Space 
Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. The 3-day meeting included updates from NASA/Roman leadership, the 
RGES PIT leadership, as well as WG leaders. Many presentations were given on Roman, microlensing planets, 
transiting planets, and software codes & tools. The meeting included a tour of the high-bay and clean room 
where Roman is actively being integrated and tested. Lastly, the final day of the meeting included hands-on 
workshops related to microlensing light curve modeling, microlensing simulation software (GULLS), and high-resolution 
image analysis with the Roman wide-field instrument (WFI).
