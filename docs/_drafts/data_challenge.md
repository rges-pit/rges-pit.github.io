## Challenge Overview

### Ground Rules

### Challenge Tiers
RMDC25 will offer two challenge "tiers:" a beginner tier for those new to microlensing, and an experienced tier for veteran microlensers.

### Submission

Submissions are validating using the [`microlens-submit`](https://microlens-submit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tool. It validates and packages submissions, and creates draft dossiers so you can preview how your submission will look to evaluators. It is also useful for managing your many events and solutions and tracking your progress. You can use this tool through the
CLI or Python API. It installs as a python package via pip;

```bash
pip install microlens-submit
```

The `microlens-submit` documentation includes [detailed specifications](https://microlens-submit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submission_manual.html) for how to create a submission. **Strict adherance to the submission criteria is required** as much of the evalution process is automated.

### Evaluation
