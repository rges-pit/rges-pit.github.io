The 27th annual International Microlensing Conference took place in January 2025 at the 
South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Cape Town, South Africa. The 3-day conference included many presentations from RGES PIT members (see list below).

On the final day of the conference, 31 January 2025, there was an excursion to the Sutherland Observatory for the opening ceremony of the PRIME telescope. PRIME is monitoring Galactic Bulge fields for microlensing events in the near-infrared H-band. This covers similar wavelengths that Roman will observe in, and PRIME also utilizes the same H4RG-10 detectors that Roman will use on its wide-field imager (WFI).


A list of presentations that were given by RGES PIT membership is below:
