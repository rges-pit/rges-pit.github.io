Vanderbilt University's Department of Physics and Astronomy 2025 participation in the [Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program](http://astro.phy.vanderbilt.edu/~reu/astro.htm) collaborated with the RGES PIT to train future microlensing astrophysicists. The participating students attended the [microlensing mini course lectures]({{ site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/outreach_mini_landing/) and were assigned RGES PIT members as advisers, with their projects all being related to the future Roman Microlensing Survey.

Vanderbilt REU coordinators:   
Keivan Stassun, Alexander Stephan, Jonathan Bird

The following students participated in the 2025 REU program on microlensing projects or were affiliated with it:

* **Catherine Rexer**  (Furman University)  
Advisers: Amber Malpas and Alexander Stephan  
Project: Hidden Binaries as the Source for Spitzer Microlensing Systematics  

* **Alina Hussain** (Illinois Institute of Technology)  
Adviser: Jessica Lu  
Project: Simulating Roman GBTDS Microlensing Lightcurves  

* **Caoimh√≠n Perkins** (Metropolitan State University of Denver)  
Advisers: Matthew Penny and Himanshu Verma  
Project: Constraining the Milky Way Bar Angle with Gaia  

* **Alaina Schweitzer** (Smith College)   
Advisers: Rachel Street and Katarzyna Kruszynska
