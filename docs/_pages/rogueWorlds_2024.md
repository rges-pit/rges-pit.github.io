Rogue Worlds 2024 was the first ever international workshop dedicated to advancing the understanding 
of free-floating planets. With new probes of this population launching in the coming years, now 
is the time to bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and observational prospects. This 
workshop brought together leading researchers from both theory and observation to foster collaboration 
and new insight on these exciting, little-understood worlds.

The group picture was taken on the second day of the workshop. Many attendees of this workshop are 
current RGES PIT members.
