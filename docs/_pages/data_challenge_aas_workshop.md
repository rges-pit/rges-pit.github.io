> | January 3 or 4, 2026 | 9 am – 5 pm | AAS 247 | Room TBD |

## Requirements

* A laptop with a functioning web browser (optionally, VS Code and Slack installed).
* Ideally, some Python experience.
* An intention to participate in the [Roman Microlensing Data Challenge 2025]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/) or be on an already signed-up team. You can sign up [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/sign-up/).
* Microlensing-specific knowledge or experience is **not** necessary.

## How to Sign Up for the Workshop

TBD

## Session Outlines

### [1. Introduction to the Nexus]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/1-nexus/)

For discussion, information, troubleshooting, and updates about the Nexus, see the `#nexus` channel and the channel canvas.
In this session we will be covering:

* Creating Nexus accounts
* How to access the Nexus
* Nexus notebook content:
    * Creating Teams
    * Microlensing open source software
    * Accessing data and creating data challenge submissions
* Installing packages and other technical help
* Using the Nexus with VSCode or Colab

### [2. Single Lenses and Pipelines]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/2-single-lenses/)

In this session, we will learn about basic microlensing parameterization and terminology and test that knowledge on a mini modeling Data Challenge.
Topics covered:

* An introduction to microlensing
* Helpful microlensing resources
* Alternate data access, for those not using the Nexus
* Hack-session where we will learn about:
    * Single lens fitting
    * Priors
    * Parallelization
    * L2 observer
    * Anomaly finding

### [3. Binary Lenses]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/3-binary-lenses/)

We will begin this session with a more complicated binary-lens model and exercises to demonstrate the challenges of binary-lens fitting and common approaches to addressing them. We will fit that same event using three different methods:

1. Start a fit from an uninformed guess
2. Start with a grid search 
3. Start from an informed guess

Some of these methods are computationally expensive, so we will parallelize our efforts and discuss common challenges in microlensing binary-lens modeling, e.g., degeneracies, stochastic likelihood space, and higher-order effects.

### [4. Information Session and Q&A]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/4-info/)

Ask the demonstrators anything you would like to know about microlensing and/or the Data Challenge.
They will also provide details on:

* The RGES-PIT website
* The Slack channel
* Sign-up
* Tiers
* Data insights
* Submission rules and guidelines
* Evaluation process and rubric
* Publication plans
* Important dates
* Contact
