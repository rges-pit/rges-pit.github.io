The third annual RGES PIT face-to-face meeting took place in October 2025 at the Ohio State University 
in Columbus, OH. The 3-day meeting included updates from NASA/Roman leadership, the 
RGES PIT leadership, as well as Working Group leaders. One of the cornerstones of this meeting was a heavy focus 
on forward-looking plans in preparation for the anticipated Roman launch and comissioning in late 2026. The meeting 
included a joint session with the TRExS wide-field science team. The final day of the meeting included many presentations 
from students and postdocs working on Roman-related projects, as well as a team-wide discussion on the RGES PIT authorship/publication 
policy and plans for early science with Roman GBTDS data.

The group picture was taken on the first day (Wednesday) of the 2025 meeting. This also includes several members of the TRExS team.
