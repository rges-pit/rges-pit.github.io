## Description

The RMDC25 AAS Workshop is a hands-on, full-day session designed to get participants—from newcomers to seasoned microlensers—set up and productive with the Roman Research Nexus and the core open-source tools used in the Roman Microlensing Data Challenge. We’ll walk through Nexus access and environment setup, introduce essential microlensing concepts and modeling workflows, explore single- and binary-lens fitting (including grid searches and practical strategies for degeneracies and higher-order effects), and show how to organize, validate, and package results for submission using microlens-submit. Bring a laptop and a willingness to experiment; light Python experience is helpful but not required. The day closes with an information session and Q&A covering timelines, tiers, data access, evaluation, and how to get help throughout the challenge.

## Requirements

* A laptop with a functioning web browser (optionally, VS Code and Slack installed).
* Ideally, some Python experience.
* An intention to participate in the [Roman Microlensing Data Challenge 2025]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/) or be on an already signed-up team. You can sign up [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/sign-up/).
* Microlensing-specific knowledge or experience is **not** necessary.

## Session Outlines

### [A. Introduction to the Nexus]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/1-nexus/)

<!-- BEGIN SESSION A OVERVIEW -->
<!-- SOURCE (session A overview): https://github.com/rges-pit/data-challenge-notebooks/blob/main/AAS%20Workshop/Session%20A%3A%20Nexus/ReadMe.md -->

In this session, you will learn how to access the Nexus, create Nexus accounts, activate kernels, install packages, access data, create your submission, and get other technical help.

In this session we will be covering:

* Creating Nexus accounts
* How to access the Nexus
* Nexus notebook content:
    * Creating Teams
    * Microlensing open source software
    * Accessing data and creating data challenge submissions
* Installing packages and other technical help
* Using the Nexus with VSCode

For discussion, information, troubleshooting, and updates about the Nexus, see the `#nexus` channel and the channel canvas.

<!-- END SESSION A OVERVIEW -->

### [2. Single Lenses and Pipelines]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/2-single-lenses/)

<!-- BEGIN SESSION B OVERVIEW -->
<!-- SOURCE (session B overview): https://github.com/rges-pit/data-challenge-notebooks/blob/main/AAS%20Workshop/Session%20B%3A%20Single%20Lens%20%26%20Pipelines/ReadMe.md -->

In this session, we will learn about basic microlensing parameterization and terminology and test that knowledge on a mini modeling Data Challenge.
Topics covered:

* An introduction to microlensing: [part 1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/_pages/outreach_mini_chapter1.html), [part 2]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/outreach_mini_chapter2.html)
* [Helpful microlensing resources]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/) 
    including [alternate data access for those not using the Nexus]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/data/)
* Hack-session where we will learn about:
    * Single lens fitting
    * Priors
    * Parallelization
    * L2 observer
    * Anomaly finding 

<!-- END SESSION B OVERVIEW -->

### [3. Binary Lenses]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/3-binary-lenses/)

<!-- BEGIN SESSION C OVERVIEW -->
<!-- SOURCE (session C overview): https://github.com/rges-pit/data-challenge-notebooks/blob/main/AAS%20Workshop/Session%20C%3A%20Binary%20Lens/ReadMe.md -->

We will use this session to explore a more complicated, binary-lens model and exercises to demonstrate the challenges of binary-lens fitting and common approaches to addressing them. We will fit that same event using three different methods:

1. Start a fit from an uninformed guess
2. Start with a grid search 
3. Start from an informed guess

Some of these methods are computationally expensive, so we will parallelize our efforts and discuss common challenges in microlensing binary-lens modeling, e.g., degeneracies, stochastic likelihood space, and higher-order effects.

<!-- END SESSION C OVERVIEW -->

### [4. Information Session and Q&A]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/data-challenge/aas-workshop/4-info/)

<!-- BEGIN SESSION D OVERVIEW -->
<!-- SOURCE (session D overview): https://github.com/rges-pit/data-challenge-notebooks/blob/main/AAS%20Workshop/Session%20D%3A%20Data%20Challenge%20Q%26A/ReadMe.md -->
