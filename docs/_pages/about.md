RGES PIT stands for the **R**oman **G**alactic **E**xoplanet **S**urvey 
**P**roject **I**nfrastructure **T**eam. Formed in 2023, our NASA-funded team is
building the software and human infrastructure required to successfully execute the exoplanet component of the
GBTDS. The 2020 Decadal Survey states that Roman is *“the only platform in the coming decades 
that can produce a statistical census of planetary occurrence as a function of orbital 
separation and mass, from terrestrials to gas giants, beyond 1 AU”*.


The exoplanet survey will make use of Roman's wide-field instrument (WFI): The RGES PIT
has four major scientific and programmatic objectives:

* Confirm and/or reconfirm the five level-2 RGES science requirements which are:
  * RGES shall be capable of measuring the mass function of exoplanets with masses 
  in the range 1 M_earth < m < 30 M_jupiter and orbital semi-major axes ≥ 1 AU to better 
  than 15% per decade in mass.
  * RGES shall be capable of measuring the frequency of bound exoplanets with masses in 
  the range 0.1 M_earth < m < 0.3 M_earth to better than 25%.
  * RGES shall be capable of determining the masses of, and distances to, host stars of 
  40% of the detected planets with a precision of 20% or better.
  * RGES shall be capable of measuring the frequency of free floating planetary-mass objects 
  in the Galaxy from Mars to 10 Jupiter masses. If there is 1 M_earth free-floating planet per star, 
  measure this frequency to better than 25%.
  * RGES shall be capable of estimating η_earth (the frequency of planets orbiting FGK stars with mass 
  ratio and estimated projected semimajor axis within 20% of the Earth-Sun system) to a precision 
  of 0.2 dex via extrapolation from larger and longer-period planets.
* Improve the microlensing event rate and yield calculations by improving the input Galactic models, 
incorporating new measurements of the near-infrared event rate obtained by the PRIME survey
* Develop and test the prototype photometry and astrometry pipeline, event detection pipeline, 
lightcurve modeling pipeline, and detection efficiency (or completeness) pipeline, with the goal of 
making these publicly-available and user-friendly
* Develop the occurrence rate formalism and methodology.
